# Development of a Skin Diseases Identification System using Machine Learning

**Main Objective**
The main objective of this research is to help patients get their skin diseases diagnosed easily through the EDermatologist application and get treatment. 

**Main Research Questions**
How does the performance of CNN models vary when trained on diverse datasets from different regions and demographics, and how can we address potential biases in the data?
Can CNN models be effectively applied to identify skin diseases in populations with different skin types or ethnicities, and how does this affect the model's performance?
Can CNN models effectively distinguish between different subtypes of skin diseases, such as differentiating between various types of skin cancer or different stages of disease progression?
How accurate are CNN models in identifying different types of skin diseases, such as melanoma, eczema, or psoriasis, compared to traditional diagnostic methods?

Develop and train a CNN model for accurate and automated skin disease diagnosis.
Collect and curate a comprehensive dataset of skin images with corresponding disease labels for training and evaluation purposes.
Optimize the CNN model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy and robust performance in skin disease classification.
Assess the CNN model's ability to differentiate between various skin disease classes, including common conditions like acne, eczema, psoriasis, as well as more severe diseases like melanoma.
